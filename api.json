      "summary": "Romanian undead vampire variant with two forms: Strigoi viu (living witch) and Strigoi mort (undead vampire). The undead form rises after death due to improper burial, suicide, evil life, or being born with a caul. Features shapeshifting, blood-drinking, and life force draining.",
      "full": "Strigoi are Romanian vampiric entities existing in two distinct forms: Strigoi viu (living witches with supernatural powers) and Strigoi mort (undead vampires that rise from the grave). The Strigoi mort is the more prominent form—a person who becomes undead after death due to factors such as improper burial, suicide, living an evil life, or being born with a caul or tail. Physical characteristics include pale skin, red eyes, and appearing as the deceased person. Strigoi mort possess powers including shapeshifting (into animals), invisibility, superhuman strength, and the ability to drain blood and life force from victims. They return to their families and villages, spreading disease and death. Detection methods include disturbed graves, uncorrupted bodies, and blood in the mouth. Prevention involves proper burial rites and placing garlic in the coffin. Destruction requires a stake through the heart, decapitation, or burning the body. The Strigoi tradition predates and influenced Bram Stoker's Dracula novel, forming the foundation of Romanian vampire mythology."
